=== Glass Unit ===
id: db.queries
version: 0.1.0
language: typescript

=== Intent ===
purpose: Provide type-safe, parameterized database access for all application queries. Abstracts D1 behind Drizzle ORM so a future Postgres migration requires only a config change, not a rewrite.

approvalStatus: approved

=== Contract ===
requires:
  - "Database instance created via createDb(d1Binding)"
  - "All IDs passed to queries are valid UUID strings"
guarantees:
  on_success:
    - "All queries are parameterized (no SQL injection possible)"
    - "List queries support pagination via limit/offset"
    - "All mutations filter by userId to enforce data isolation"
    - "getEntryById eagerly loads associated media records"
  on_failure:
    - "Database errors are propagated, not swallowed"
    - "Partial writes do not corrupt data (D1 auto-rollback)"
invariants:
  - "Users can only read/write their own data (userId filter on every query)"
  - "Drizzle query builder generates valid SQLite SQL"
fails:
  RecordNotFound: "Return null for single-record lookups"
  DatabaseError: "Propagate with original error context"
